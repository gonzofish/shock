# Shock

A static site generator built in Elixir.
Built mostly to get my feet wetter with Elixir!

Taking cues from
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
[Obelisk](https://github.com/BennyHallett/obelisk/), and others!

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `shock` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:shock, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/shock](https://hexdocs.pm/shock).
